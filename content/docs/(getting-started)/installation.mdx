<Steps>

<Step>Create a project</Step>

Run the `init` command to create a new Next.js project or to setup an existing one:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest init
```

<Step>Add components</Step>

You can now start adding components to your project.

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add "https://molcuelui.design/r/swipe-row"
```

<Step>Import component</Step>

```tsx
import { SwipeRow } from "@/components/ui/swipe-row";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <SwipeRow />
    </div>
  );
}
```

</Steps>
