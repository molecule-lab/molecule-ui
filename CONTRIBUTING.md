1. Generate Component

   ```
   npm generate:component
   ```

   This will created the following files

   ```
   registry
   ├── molecule-ui
   │   └── example-component.tsx
   ├── example
   │   └── example-component-demo.tsx
   content
   └── docs
       └── components
           └── example-component.mdx
   public
   └── r
       ├── example-component.json
       └── example-component-demo.json
   ```

2. Edit Component

   Edit the main component in `registry/molecule-ui/example-component.tsx`

3. Edit Component Demo

   Provide a basic example to showcase your component in `registry/example/example-component-demo.tsx`

4. Edit Docs

   Edit MDX file for documenting your component in `content/docs/components/example-component.mdx`
